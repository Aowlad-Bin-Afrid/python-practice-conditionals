###  Overview
This project is part of my Python learning journey.

###  What’s Inside
**File:** `if_else_demo.py`  
It contains several beginner-friendly exercises that use:
- `if`, `elif`, `else` conditional statements  
- Arithmetic operators like `+`, `%`, and comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`)  
- Logical decision-making based on user input
